# Lovable UI \nthis folder holds all UI code generated by Lovable with prompts from `}/lovable_prompts`. It is used strictly for temporary frontend code that can be tested, visualized, or merged into the cloud-run app if desired.

## Status
- Rendered using Lovable
- No manual crafting or checks
- Not part of agent runtime logic

`lovable_ui/
  - Result of prompts like "Generate a react component that calls the /api/generate utility"
  - Usually prototyped rendering output view (if typescript) or restructured HTML
   - Intended to be user-previewable in development or admin reflightion
  - All files can be safely deleted and overritten in future phase

## Where This Fits in Vana

- Visual/interface design tests
- Contact renderers (from Lovable) static views
- Static utils (filters, search)
- Any features we wish to begin with react/html code will live here

## What this Folder Is not
- This is not part of the agent logic or runtime Supase data path
- Not connected to `agents` read/write actions
- Not analyzed or meanwither via gemini or context strategies


## Recommended Use

- ``prompts`` in `lovable_prompts` are developer-only tooling inputs
- Lovable code can be pasted here to preview prompt generation
- During per-task integration, output can be copied elsewhere or swap via RooCode.
