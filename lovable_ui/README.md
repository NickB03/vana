# Lovable UI - Vana Project

This folder holds the code generated by Lovable to render frontend user interfaces for Vana, a prompt-driven, agent-based logic application deployed on Cloud Run and Supabase. This is the frontend counterpart to the agent-backend insights, meaning it should only contain UI code generated based on Nick-crafted Lovable prompts.

The code in this folder is not connected to the agent models at runtime, and should not be modified without express intent. It can be used for testing, demos or leveraging display for access to agent-generated actions.

Lovable prompts are developer-target instructions, and their output can be pasted here for render time viewing without altering internals of the core application.
