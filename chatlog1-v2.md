## Tactical Reconstruction: Vana Phase 1 Memory Activation
This file contains a surgically accurated, structured, tactical extraction of the original chat session (Main Chatlog1.md) for operational continuity.

---
# Context Captured
- Vana project launching Phase 1 (single-agent deployment)
- Initial agent architecture based on ADK framework
- Priority: External memory (RAG) operationalized before MCP or advanced Vertex scaling

## Core Tactical Decisions
- Ragie.ai selected as temporary RAG provider
- Free-tier constraints accepted knowingly for MVP timeline speed
- No GCS, Pinecone, S3 vector storage attempted that could delay Phase 1
- Tactical acceptance of "dirty but fast" RAG external memory

## Governance Rules Applied
- Real Talk mode enforced - praise suppression active
- Sidequest drift governance - ADHD higher operational drift mitigation
- Manual checkpointing plans developed for session collapse resilience
- Critical memory externalization mandate reaffirmed

## Current Position (End of Chatlog1)
- Preparing tactical knowledge harvesting from ADK, Vertex, and MCP
- Phase 1 mission lock intact
- Session fragility acknowledged – restart planning tactical memory vaulting
