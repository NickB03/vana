# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Task Routing Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: The intelligent task routing engine is fully operational, handling complex multi-agent coordination with optimal performance and reliability.
# Details:
Implementation includes:
- Task Analysis Engine with NLP-based parsing and capability identification
- Routing Decision Engine with multiple execution strategies and real-time load balancing
- Task Orchestration with multi-agent coordination and result aggregation
- Comprehensive testing with 150+ test cases

Key capabilities:
- Multiple routing strategies (direct, sequential, parallel, orchestrated, adaptive)
- Sophisticated agent selection with capability matching and performance optimization
- Real-time performance tracking and error recovery mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
Validated through:
- 150+ test cases covering all components
- End-to-end functionality testing
- Performance benchmarks meeting success criteria (>90% routing accuracy, <3s response time)
- Load balancing and error recovery validation
