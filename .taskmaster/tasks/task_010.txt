# Task ID: 10
# Title: Set Up Pre-commit Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automate code quality checks with pre-commit hooks.
# Details:
Configure pre-commit hooks to run `flake8`, `black`, and `mypy` before commits. Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
```

# Test Strategy:
Test the hooks by making a commit and verifying checks run.
