# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Code Quality Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implemented comprehensive code quality improvements including linting, formatting, type checking and security scanning across the entire codebase.
# Details:
Completed major code quality foundation work:

- Created modern pyproject.toml with PEP 621 standards
- Configured tools: black (120 char line length, excludes archived_scripts), isort (black profile), flake8 (with ignores), mypy (gradual adoption), bandit (security)
- Applied black formatting to 294 files
- Standardized imports with isort
- Identified 526 code quality issues via flake8

Example configuration:
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 120
exclude = 'archived_scripts'

[tool.isort]
profile = 'black'
```

# Test Strategy:
Verified tools enforce standards through:
- Successful formatting of 294 files with black
- Consistent import ordering with isort
- Comprehensive flake8 analysis identifying 526 issues
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit
