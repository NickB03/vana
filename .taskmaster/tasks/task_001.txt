# Task ID: 1
# Title: Debug Code Audit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze and categorize all 2,536 print statements found in the codebase (updated from initial estimate of 782).
# Details:
The audit has been completed using grep and a Python script to scan 138 Python files. Results show print statements categorized by file location (tests, scripts, agents, lib, dashboard) and purpose (formatted output, general, testing, error handling, info, result display, debug). Deliverables include debug_audit_report.json, debug_audit_analyzer.py, and categorized data.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the accuracy of categorization by reviewing sample files from each category, with special attention to the top files with most print statements (specialist.py, test_adk_memory_monitoring.py, coordination_benchmarks.py).
