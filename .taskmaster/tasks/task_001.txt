# Task ID: 1
# Title: Diagnose Agent-Tool Integration Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy and verify the simplified agent implementation that resolves the instruction length issue causing communication failures in Cloud Run environment.
# Details:
Root cause identified: excessive agent instruction length (9,935 chars) caused processing failures. Solution implemented with simplified instructions (~800 chars) maintaining all 12 essential tools. Need to verify deployment in Cloud Run environment and confirm improved success rate.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy simplified agent to Cloud Run dev environment and verify: 1) Proper tool execution patterns, 2) >50% success rate improvement, 3) No generic 'System health' responses, 4) All 12 tools remain functional.
