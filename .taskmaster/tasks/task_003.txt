# Task ID: 3
# Title: Replace Debug Prints with Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace identified print statements with appropriate log calls.
# Details:
For each print statement identified in Task 1, replace it with a corresponding log call (e.g., `logging.debug`, `logging.info`). Ensure log messages are descriptive and context-rich. Example:
```python
# Before
print('Processing file:', filename)
# After
logging.info('Processing file: %s', filename)
```

# Test Strategy:
Run the application and verify that log messages appear as expected in the configured output.
