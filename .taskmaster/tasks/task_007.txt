# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enable Advanced Features
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement features enabled by new dependencies after completing code quality improvements.
# Details:
After automated code cleanup (Phase 2), update code to utilize the new dependencies (e.g., PDF processing with PyPDF2, image processing with Pillow). Ensure graceful degradation if dependencies are missing. Build upon the completed Phase 1 fixes (critical syntax errors and import corrections).

# Test Strategy:
Test features with and without optional dependencies to verify functionality and fallback behavior. Ensure tests run after code quality improvements are complete.

# Subtasks:
## 7.1. Wait for Phase 2 code quality improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Hold until automated cleanup of remaining code quality issues is complete
