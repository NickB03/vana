# Task ID: 2
# Title: Logging Framework Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Python logging with appropriate handlers and formatters.
# Details:
Use Python's built-in `logging` module. Configure handlers (e.g., `StreamHandler`, `FileHandler`) and formatters for structured logging. Set log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) based on the environment (development, production). Example:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)
```

# Test Strategy:
Test logging output in different environments to ensure correct log levels and formats are applied.
