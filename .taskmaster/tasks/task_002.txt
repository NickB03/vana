# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Python logging framework with comprehensive features and environment-specific configurations implemented successfully.
# Details:
✅ COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED:

📁 **Core Components Implemented:**
1. **lib/logging_config.py** - Centralized logging configuration with environment detection
2. **lib/logging_utils.py** - Convenient logging utilities, decorators, and mixins
3. **config/logging.yaml** - YAML configuration file for advanced logging setup
4. **test_logging_framework.py** - Comprehensive test suite for validation

🔧 **Features Implemented:**
- Environment Detection: Automatic detection of production (Cloud Run), development, and testing environments
- Multi-Handler Support: Console, file, error-specific, and JSON logging handlers
- Structured Logging: Integration with existing StructuredLogger for correlation IDs and context
- Log Rotation: Automatic log file rotation with 10MB size limit and 5 backup files
- Performance Logging: Decorators for function performance monitoring
- Context Management: Log operation start/end with execution time tracking
- Correlation IDs: Cross-component operation tracking support

🎯 **Environment-Specific Configuration:**
- **Production (Cloud Run)**: INFO level, /tmp/logs directory, structured JSON logging
- **Development**: DEBUG level, project/logs directory, detailed file logging
- **Testing**: WARNING level, console-only logging

# Test Strategy:
✅ **Testing Results:**
- All logging framework tests passed successfully
- Environment detection working correctly
- Log level configuration functional
- File handlers creating logs in appropriate directories
- Structured logging with correlation IDs operational
- Performance monitoring and context managers working
- LoggerMixin providing easy class-based logging
