# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Agent Discovery System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Developed and implemented a comprehensive agent discovery and coordination system.
# Details:
Successfully implemented real-time agent discovery with capability detection and metadata extraction. Created caching system with TTL for performance. Implemented full coordination tools including task routing based on capabilities. Replaced all stub implementations with functional discovery and coordination logic.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive test suite (test_coordination_implementation.py) validates agent discovery functionality, coordination tool behavior, ADK tools integration, and provides detailed test reporting.
