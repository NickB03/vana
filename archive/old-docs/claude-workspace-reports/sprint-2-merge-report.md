### 📊 Merge Process Details

#### PR #107: State Management
- **Merged at**: 10:59 AM
- **Method**: Squash merge
- **No conflicts**: Direct merge successful

#### PR #108: OAuth Implementation  
- **Merged at**: 11:02 AM
- **Method**: Squash merge
- **Conflicts resolved**: package.json dependencies

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Resolve PR #109 Conflicts**
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/sprint-2-pr-6-auth-ui
   git merge origin/main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git push
   ```

2. **Update Remaining PRs**
   - Each PR needs to be rebased on latest main
   - Resolve conflicts as they arise
   - Push updates to trigger new CI builds

3. **Sequential Merge Order**
   - PR #109 → #110 → #111 → #112 → #113 → #114
   - Maintain dependency order

### 🚦 Current Main Branch Status

- **Latest commit**: 7e07ab7d (PR #108 merge)
- **Features integrated**:
  - ✅ State management architecture
  - ✅ Google OAuth authentication
  - ⏳ UI components (pending)
  - ⏳ Protected routes (pending)
  - ⏳ Homepage (pending)
  - ⏳ Theme (pending)
  - ⏳ SSE infrastructure (pending)
  - ⏳ Testing setup (pending)

### 📝 Recommendations

1. **Manual Conflict Resolution Required**
   - The remaining 6 PRs have merge conflicts due to the sequential nature of the changes
   - Each needs individual attention to resolve conflicts

2. **Alternative Approach**
   - Consider creating a single integration branch
   - Cherry-pick commits from each PR
   - Resolve all conflicts at once
   - Create single PR to main

3. **CI Considerations**
   - Current CI failures are expected (tests not implemented)
   - Can be merged despite CI status if code review passes

### 🎯 Swarm Performance Metrics

- **Initialization time**: 0.36ms
- **Agents spawned**: 4
- **Task orchestration**: 0.35ms
- **Successful merges**: 2/8 (25%)
- **Manual intervention required**: 6/8 (75%)

### 📋 Summary

The swarm successfully coordinated the merge of 2 foundational PRs (#107, #108). The remaining 6 PRs require manual conflict resolution due to the cascading nature of the changes. Each PR builds on the previous ones, creating dependency conflicts that need individual attention.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with manual conflict resolution for PRs #109-114 in sequence, or consider an integration branch approach to resolve all conflicts at once.
