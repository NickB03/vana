# Archive

This directory contains historical one-time files from development sessions that are no longer actively used but preserved for reference.

## Structure

### `/reports`
Development reports and documentation from specific feature implementations:
- `ARTIFACT_ENHANCEMENTS_ISSUE.md` - Issue tracking and fixes for artifact rendering
- `DUPLICATE_PLUGINS_FIX.md` - Claude Code plugin duplication resolution

## Purpose

These files document the development history and decision-making process for key features. They are archived to:
- Keep the project root clean
- Preserve context for future reference
- Document implementation approaches that worked/didn't work
- Serve as examples for similar future work

## Note

These files are not actively maintained. For current documentation, refer to `CLAUDE.md` in the project root.
