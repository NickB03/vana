# This file is automatically @generated by Poetry and should not be changed by hand.
# 
# This is an EXAMPLE of what poetry.lock should look like.
# The actual poetry.lock file is committed to the repository and contains
# the exact versions of all dependencies used in the project.
#
# For VANA project:
# - poetry.lock IS committed to git (not in .gitignore)
# - This ensures reproducible builds across environments
# - All team members get the same dependency versions
# - Production deployments use exact same versions as development
#
# To regenerate poetry.lock:
# 1. Delete poetry.lock
# 2. Run: poetry install
# 3. Commit the new poetry.lock file
#
# Key dependencies for VANA:
# - google-adk: Agent Development Kit framework
# - fastapi: Web framework for API endpoints
# - google-cloud-aiplatform: Vertex AI integration
# - google-genai: Google Generative AI
# - pydantic: Data validation
# - uvicorn: ASGI server
#
# Development dependencies:
# - pre-commit: Git hooks for code quality
# - pytest: Testing framework
# - black: Code formatting
# - ruff: Linting
#
# The actual poetry.lock file contains hundreds of packages with exact versions,
# checksums, and dependency trees. This ensures that:
# 1. Local development matches production exactly
# 2. CI/CD builds are reproducible
# 3. No "works on my machine" issues
# 4. Security through verified package integrity
