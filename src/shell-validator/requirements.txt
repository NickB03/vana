# Shell Script Validator Requirements
# 
# Core Python dependencies for the shell script validation engine
# All dependencies use only Python standard library modules for maximum compatibility

# Note: This validator is designed to use only Python standard library modules
# to ensure broad compatibility and minimal installation requirements.
# 
# The following standard library modules are used:
# - re (regular expressions)
# - json (JSON handling)
# - pathlib (path operations)
# - subprocess (Git integration)
# - argparse (CLI parsing)
# - unittest (testing framework)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - enum (enumerations)
# - time (performance measurement)
# - logging (error reporting)
# - tempfile (testing utilities)
# - os, sys (system operations)

# Development dependencies (optional)
# These are only needed for development and testing, not for runtime

# Code formatting (optional)
# black>=22.0.0

# Linting (optional)  
# flake8>=4.0.0
# pylint>=2.12.0

# Testing utilities (optional)
# coverage>=6.0.0

# Documentation (optional)
# sphinx>=4.0.0

# The validator itself requires only Python 3.7+ with standard library modules.
# This design choice ensures:
# 1. Maximum compatibility across different environments
# 2. Minimal installation overhead  
# 3. No dependency conflicts
# 4. Reliable operation in restricted environments
# 5. Fast startup times
# 6. Easy deployment in CI/CD pipelines
