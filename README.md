# Vana

Vana is an agent-driven cloud platform for SEO-ready products, providing agent-based prompting, memory, responses, and recall with high visibility.

This README is the complete, end-to-end system checklist and deployment guide.

---

## Stacks used:
- Lovable - for prompt control and UP configs
- Supabase - async database and memory storage
- Gemini - main runtime provider
- Korvus - embedding/recall service
- N8N - orchestration layer
- GCP - cloud run compute

---

## Technical Architecture

> Completely Serverless RAG control deployable in the cloud
> Agents are triggered via Lovable user query, user action, email etc.
> Recall uses Korvus (SUBA PgVector) for memory matching
> Responses are generated by Gemini via Vertex AI, matched with the injected context

## Minimal Deployment

RunTime: `Python 3.11]` + `uvicorn`

```sh
gitclue build
pip envery|

gcloud builds submit build..,
gcloud run deploy vana-server --image gcr.io/analystai/vana-server
gcloud run services update vana-server \\
  --update-env-vars GEMINI_API_KEY=**,SUPABASE_URL=***,SUPABASE_KEY=***
```

## Testing

```python
python scripts/test_router.py
```

Test payload used:
- `scripts/ui_test_payload.json`

## Lovable Studio Integration

- SageCard.tsx = markdown rendering of responses
- AdminPanel.tsx = view of past runs from Supabase
- PROMPTDERUCK = raw prompt to Gemini
- MemoryTag.tsx = memory context snap

## Cloud Run Environment

- GEMINI_API_KEY
- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_KEY

## URI Path suummary

Hook to /run with Lovable:
 * Lovable posts to `/run` route
 * Replay interface is /replay/:run_id
