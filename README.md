# 🧠 | Project Vana (Virtual Autonomous Neural Agents)

Project Vana is a fully functional, cloud-ready AI agent team designed to support and accelerate software development and creative projects.
This is a highly synthetic product platform + portfolio package that can scale interiors.

Current features:

- CrewAI-based agents with defined personas, goals, and background.
- n8n for orchestration and external API integrations.
- Supabase as backend (auth, DB, storage).
- Lovable.dev for generating the real frontend UI -- no mocks, real logic.
- Extensible RAG memory (Korvus + Vertex AI on GCP).
