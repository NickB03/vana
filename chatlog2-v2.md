## Tactical Reconstruction: Vana Phase 1 Memory Activation (Part 2)
This file continues the structured tactical extraction based on the second major segment of the chat session (Main Chatlog2.md).

---

# Context Captured
- Mid-session adjustments regarding Ragie integration.
- Discussions about document ingestion methods and Drive integration constraints.
- Clarified that GitHub integration was not an available option for Ragie free-tier.

## Core Tactical Decisions
- Google Drive selected as temporary ingestion pipeline.
- Explicitly decided not to ingest full Vana repo to avoid noise and semantic drift.
- Tactical selection of core project files (readme, architecture notes, tactical checklists) for memory ingestion.
- Deferred building custom MCP server until post-Phase 1.

## Governance Rules Reaffirmed
- Scope control reasserted during Ragie/Drive setup challenges.
- Recognized and blocked potential drift into full infrastructure ops during Phase 1.
- Manual document curation selected over full repo ingestion to maintain tactical memory signal quality.

## Current Position (End of Chatlog2)
- Preparing to curate, upload, and connect tactical document memory set into Ragie.
- No deviation from Phase 1 mission.
- Phase 2 infrastructure work (MCP servers, custom API layers) clearly scheduled for post-MVP.
