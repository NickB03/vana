## Architecture Overview

VANA is a multi-agent AI system built on Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with optimized orchestration patterns. The system uses AGOR-inspired coordination with dynamic agent creation and intelligent tool management.

### Core Design Principles
- **Dynamic Agent Orchestration** - Strategy-based execution with on-demand agent creation
- **Advanced Tool Optimization** - Intelligent caching, consolidation, and performance monitoring
- **AGOR-Style Coordination** - Enhanced agent communication with session state management
- **Enhanced Tool Standardization** - Consistent interfaces across 59+ tools
- **Cloud-Native Design** - Google Cloud integration with auto-scaling and resilience

### Agent Architecture
- **VANA Orchestrator** (`agents/vana/team.py`) - Central coordinator with comprehensive toolset
  - Core tools (file operations, search, system tools)
  - Conditional tools (specialist capabilities, orchestration tools)
  - Agent coordination tools (delegation, status monitoring)
  - Workflow management tools (multi-step workflow execution)
- **Code Execution Specialist** (`agents/code_execution/specialist.py`) - Secure sandboxed execution
  - Python, JavaScript, Shell execution with resource monitoring
  - Security validation and timeout management
  - Integration with VANA for complex development tasks
- **Data Science Specialist** (`agents/data_science/specialist.py`) - Data analysis and ML
  - Leverages Code Execution Specialist for secure Python execution
  - Data processing, visualization, statistical computing
- **Proxy Agents** - Discovery pattern for backward compatibility
  - Memory, Orchestration, Specialists, Workflows agents delegate to VANA

## Development Guidelines

### Agent Development
- Follow Google ADK patterns with proper tool registration using `adk.FunctionTool`
- Implement comprehensive error handling and structured logging
- Use security best practices with input validation and access control
- Leverage the AI Agent Testing Framework for validation

### Tool Implementation Standards
- All tools follow standardized patterns in `lib/_tools/`
- Use structured logging via `lib/logging/structured_logger.py`
- Implement proper input validation and error handling
- Include type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Follow the tool standardization patterns established in existing implementations

### Testing Approach
VANA includes a comprehensive **AI Agent Testing Framework** (`tests/framework/`):
- **`agent_intelligence_validator.py`** - Tests reasoning consistency and tool selection
- **`response_quality_analyzer.py`** - Analyzes accuracy, completeness, relevance
- **`adk_compliance_validator.py`** - Validates Google ADK patterns and integration
- **`performance_benchmarker.py`** - Response times, throughput, resource usage

### Security Requirements
- No hardcoded credentials - use Google Secret Manager integration
- Implement proper access control for sensitive operations
- Use audit logging for security-relevant actions (`lib/security/audit_logger.py`)
- Follow OWASP security guidelines for web components

### Code Style & Quality
- Use Black with 120 character line length

### Required Environment Variables (in .env.local)
```bash
# Core Configuration
VANA_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash  # Default AI model
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development  # or production
```

### Google Cloud Setup

# System-level Tesseract (for OCR)
brew install tesseract  # macOS
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Agent Tool Registration
```python
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool

def create_my_tool():
    return FunctionTool(
        name="my_tool",
        description="Tool description",
        parameters={...},
        function=my_function
    )
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    result = perform_operation()
    return {"success": True, "result": result}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

### Structured Logging
```python
from lib.logging.structured_logger import logger

logger.info("Operation started",
           extra={"operation": "example", "user_id": "123"})
```

### Working Knowledge Management
The `memory-bank/` directory contains working knowledge for AI agents:
- **`memory-bank/00-core/`** - Core system status and documentation
- **`memory-bank/project-docs/`** - Implementation guides and architectural decisions
- **Update this when making significant changes to maintain AI agent continuity**

## Important Implementation Notes

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Real agents: VANA Orchestrator, Code Execution Specialist, Data Science Specialist
- Proxy pattern for discovery compatibility with legacy agent references
- Coordination through standardized ADK patterns and tool interfaces

### Tool Architecture
- 59+ standardized tools with consistent interfaces
- Intelligent caching and performance optimization
- Conditional tool loading based on available dependencies
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

### Deployment
- Production: Google Cloud Run with auto-scaling
- Development: Local Poetry environment with Docker support
- CI/CD: Automated deployment scripts in `deployment/` directory

This architecture provides a robust foundation for AI-powered multi-agent applications with comprehensive tooling, security, and monitoring capabilities.
