# Project VANA Documentation

[Home](../../index.md) > Project Documentation

This section contains documents related to the overall VANA project, including its goals, roadmap, development status, and contribution guidelines.

## Key Project Documents

*   **[Project Roadmap](roadmap.md):**
    Outlines the high-level goals, phases, and future direction of Project VANA. This includes the current MVP focus (functional single agent) and the longer-term vision for a Multi-Agent System (MAS).

*   **Implementation Plans:**
    - **[Vector Search Enhancement Implementation Plan](implementation-plans/vector-search-enhancement-plan.md):** Detailed plan for enhancing the Vector Search subsystem with integration testing, deployment configuration, and security enhancements.

*   **Assessments:**
    - **[Unified Web Interface Assessment](assessments/unified-web-interface-assessment.md):** Comprehensive assessment for creating a ChatGPT-style UI with advanced monitoring capabilities, integrating existing dashboards and authentication systems.
    - **[Prebuilt Interface Research](assessments/prebuilt-interface-research.md):** Research on existing open-source solutions to accelerate development, including LibreChat, assistant-ui, and dashboard templates.
    - **[Web UI Branch Comparison](assessments/web-ui-branch-comparison.md):** Comparative analysis of existing feat/web-ui-assessment branch implementation vs. current research recommendations, with hybrid approach strategy.

*   **[Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md):** (Located in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`)
    Tracks significant changes, new features, bug fixes, and version history for the VANA project. *(Note: The plan indicates this is in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, please verify its location and ensure it's actively maintained).*

*   **[Contributing Guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md):** (Located in the root directory)
    Provides guidelines for developers contributing to the VANA project, covering coding standards, testing procedures, branching strategy, and the pull request process.

*   **[License](../../LICENSE):** (Located in the root directory)
    Contains the full text of the MIT License under which Project VANA is distributed.

*   **[Sprint Status (Example)](sprint-status.md):**
    This file (`sprint-status.md`) and potentially others in a `sprints/` subdirectory might contain historical or current sprint-level status updates, plans, or reviews. These are typically more transient than the overall roadmap. *(This is an example link; the actual organization of sprint documents may vary).*
