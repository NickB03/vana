- Intelligent domain routing and task coordination
- Cross-domain context preservation and memory management

**Tier 2: Domain Supervisors (5 Agents)**
1. **Development Supervisor** - Software development and technical tasks
2. **Research & Analysis Supervisor** - Information gathering and analysis
3. **Life & Personal Supervisor** - Personal assistance and life management
4. **Communication Supervisor** - Content creation and communication
5. **Planning & Strategy Supervisor** - Strategic planning and decision making

**Tier 3: Specialist Agents (20 Agents)**
- **Development Domain (4 agents)**: Coding Specialist, Documentation Writer, Testing Coordinator, Architecture Designer
- **Research & Analysis Domain (4 agents)**: Web Search Specialist, Data Analyst, Competitive Intelligence, Academic Researcher
- **Life & Personal Domain (4 agents)**: Travel Planner, Personal Assistant, Finance Advisor, Health & Wellness Coach
- **Communication Domain (4 agents)**: Email Composer, Content Writer, Presentation Creator, Social Media Manager
- **Planning & Strategy Domain (4 agents)**: Project Planner, Decision Analyst, Workflow Optimizer, Strategic Advisor

## Key Innovations

### 1. Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture

- **Domain Expertise**: Each agent optimized for specific tasks
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic task delegation to most appropriate specialist
- **Cross-Domain Collaboration**: Agents can work together across domains

### 2. Comprehensive MCP Integration Strategy
- **19 Official MCP Servers**: github, gitlab, git, brave-search, fetch, google-maps, gdrive, postgres, sqlite, redis, memory, time, slack, filesystem, sequentialthinking, puppeteer, sentry, everything, aws-kb-retrieval
- **Domain-Specific Assignment**: Each MCP server assigned to most relevant agents
- **Universal Access**: Critical servers (memory, filesystem) accessible across all domains
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when MCP servers unavailable

### 3. ADK Compliance & Compatibility
- **AgentTool Coordination**: Maintains existing ADK patterns
- **Built-in Tool Integration**: Proper separation of built-in and custom tools
- **Session Management**: Enhanced session handling across agent hierarchy
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal impact on existing system performance
