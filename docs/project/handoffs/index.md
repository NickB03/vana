# Project Handoffs

[Home](../../../index.md) > [Project Documentation](../index.md) > Handoffs

This directory contains handoff documents for transitioning work between AI agents during the VANA project development. Each handoff document provides context, current state, and next steps for continuing development.

## Contents

### MVP Development Phase Handoffs

- **[Phase 2 to Phase 3 Handoff](phase2-to-phase3-handoff.md)**: Transition from Agent Core Scaffolding to Tool Integration
- **[Phase 3 to Phase 4 Handoff](phase3-to-phase4-handoff.md)**: Transition from Tool Integration to Memory Integration & Knowledge Graph
- **[Phase 4 to Phase 5 Handoff](phase4-to-phase5-handoff.md)**: Transition from Memory Integration to Agent Interface & End-to-End Testing

### MVP Completion Handoffs

- **[MVP Completion Handoff](mvp-completion-handoff.md)**: Final handoff documenting the completed MVP and readiness for deployment
- **[Post-MVP Development Handoff](post-mvp-development-handoff.md)**: Comprehensive handoff for continuing development after MVP completion
- **[ADK Integration Completion Handoff](adk-integration-completion-handoff.md)**: Handoff after successful Google ADK integration with proper LLM support and clean agent configuration

### Repository Enhancement Handoffs

- **[Repository Cleanup Completion Handoff](repository-cleanup-completion-handoff.md)**: Handoff after successful repository cleanup, consolidation, and preparation for AI agent best practices implementation
- **[AI Agent Best Practices Completion Handoff](ai-agent-best-practices-completion-handoff.md)**: Handoff after successful implementation of PLAN/ACT mode switching, confidence scoring, and enhanced agent coordination

## Handoff Document Structure

Each handoff document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of current state and key accomplishments
2. **Progress Summary**: Detailed status of completed work
3. **Required Files and Code Review**: Critical files to read and component status
4. **Next Steps and Priorities**: Immediate actions and development priorities
5. **Context and Constraints**: Project context, technical constraints, and user preferences
6. **Environment Setup**: Instructions for setting up the development environment
7. **Testing Strategy**: Testing requirements and procedures
8. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
9. **Code Quality Standards**: Documentation, testing, and commit requirements

## How to Use Handoff Documents

### For Incoming AI Agents

1. **Start with the most recent handoff document** (currently [AI Agent Best Practices Completion Handoff](ai-agent-best-practices-completion-handoff.md))
2. **Read the memory bank files** referenced in the handoff document
3. **Review the required files** listed in the handoff document
4. **Follow the environment setup instructions** to get the development environment running
5. **Execute the immediate actions** listed in the next steps section
6. **Understand the project context** and constraints before making changes

### For Outgoing AI Agents

1. **Create a new handoff document** following the established structure
2. **Update the current state** and progress summary
3. **Document any new issues** or incomplete features
4. **Define clear next steps** and priorities for the incoming agent
5. **Test the handoff** by following your own instructions
6. **Update this index** to include the new handoff document

## Project Context

The VANA project is an AI agent with memory and knowledge graph capabilities. The project follows a documentation-first approach with thorough testing and incremental development. All handoffs should maintain this approach and provide clear, actionable guidance for continuing development.
