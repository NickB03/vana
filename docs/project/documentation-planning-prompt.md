# Project Vana Documentation Structure and Planning Task

## Context
You are Agent 1 in a team of parallel agents working on Project Vana, a personal portfolio project that implements an AI agent system with memory persistence, vector search capabilities, and web search integration. Your specific task is to analyze the current documentation structure and create a comprehensive plan for documentation updates across the project.

## Your Specific Task
As Agent 1, you are responsible for:

1. Analyzing the current documentation structure and content
2. Creating a comprehensive documentation plan that will guide the work of other agents
3. Establishing documentation standards and templates
4. Identifying documentation gaps and redundancies
5. Creating a clear roadmap for documentation updates

## Required Background Knowledge
Before beginning your task, thoroughly review:

1. The Memory Bank files in `/memory-bank/` directory:
   - `activeContext.md` - Current project focus and recent accomplishments
   - `progress.md` - Detailed progress reports
   - `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technical context and dependencies
   - `projectbrief.md` - Project goals and requirements
   - `productContext.md` - Product context and user needs

2. The current documentation structure:
   - `/docs/` directory and its subdirectories
   - `/docs/index.md` - Main documentation index
   - `/docs/README.md` - Documentation overview
   - Any existing documentation reorganization plans or summaries

3. The codebase structure:
   - Key directories and their purposes
   - Main components and their relationships
   - Recent code changes and their impact on documentation

## Documentation Analysis Requirements
Your analysis should include:

1. **Current State Assessment**:
   - Evaluate the organization and completeness of existing documentation
   - Identify documentation that is outdated, redundant, or missing
   - Assess the alignment between code and documentation

2. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Identify components, features, or processes that lack proper documentation
   - Determine which documentation needs to be created from scratch
   - Identify documentation that needs significant updates

3. **Structure Evaluation**:
   - Assess the current documentation directory structure
   - Determine if the current organization is logical and intuitive
   - Identify any structural changes needed for better navigation and discoverability

## Documentation Plan Requirements
Your plan should include:

1. **Documentation Structure**:
   - Confirm or propose modifications to the current documentation directory structure
   - Define the purpose and scope of each documentation section
   - Establish clear navigation paths between related documentation

2. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Define formatting standards for different types of documentation
   - Establish naming conventions for documentation files
   - Create templates for common documentation types (architecture, implementation, guides)

3. **Documentation Tasks**:
   - Create a detailed list of specific documentation tasks
   - Prioritize tasks based on importance and dependencies
   - Group related tasks that should be assigned to the same agent

4. **Dependencies and Sequencing**:
   - Identify dependencies between documentation tasks
   - Establish a logical sequence for documentation updates
   - Define clear handoff points between agents

## Deliverables
1. **Documentation Analysis Report**:
   - Assessment of current documentation state
   - Identification of gaps, redundancies, and structural issues
   - Recommendations for improvement

2. **Comprehensive Documentation Plan**:
   - Detailed structure for all documentation
   - Standards and templates for documentation creation
   - Prioritized list of documentation tasks with dependencies

3. **Agent Task Assignments**:
   - Proposed grouping of documentation tasks for other agents
   - Clear definition of responsibilities for each agent
   - Dependencies between agent tasks

4. **Documentation Roadmap**:
   - Timeline for documentation updates
   - Milestones and checkpoints
   - Success criteria for documentation completion

## Coordination with Other Agents
Your work will directly guide the tasks of other agents in the documentation update effort. Ensure your plan:

1. Creates clear, non-overlapping task boundaries for other agents
2. Establishes consistent standards that all agents will follow
3. Defines clear dependencies and handoff points between agents
4. Provides templates that other agents can use for consistency

## Final Steps
After completing your analysis and plan:

1. Create a comprehensive document that includes all deliverables
2. Commit your changes to the sprint5 branch with a clear commit message
3. Ensure all templates and standards are accessible to other agents

Remember that your work forms the foundation for all other documentation efforts, so thoroughness, clarity, and attention to detail are essential.
