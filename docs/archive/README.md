- **GLM-4.6-API-REFERENCE.md** - API reference for GLM models (deprecated)
- **GLM-4.7-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md** - Migration guide between GLM versions (deprecated)
- **RFC-001-TOOL-RESULT-FORMAT-REFACTOR.md** - Tool result format for GLM (obsoleted by Gemini migration)

These files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer applicable to the current Gemini-based architecture.
