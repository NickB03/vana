## 🚧 Documentation Rewrite in Progress

We are completely rewriting all documentation to ensure accuracy and reflect the actual system state.

### Why the Rewrite?
- Previous documentation claimed "FULLY OPERATIONAL" status when validation showed 46.2% working
- Missing critical dependency information (e.g., psutil)
- Inaccurate architectural descriptions
- No documentation of known issues or limitations

### Documentation Standards
All new documentation will:
- ✅ Be validated against actual code
- ✅ Include all dependencies and requirements
- ✅ Clearly mark "Working" vs "Planned" features
- ✅ Include troubleshooting for known issues
- ✅ Provide realistic examples that actually work
