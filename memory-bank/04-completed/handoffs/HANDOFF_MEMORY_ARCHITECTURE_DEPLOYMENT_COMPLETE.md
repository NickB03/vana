## 🎯 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS FOR NEXT AGENT

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 1: Execute Agent Behavior Optimization**

**Script Ready:** `scripts/optimize_agent_memory_behavior.py`
**Goal:** Update all agent prompts with memory-first strategy
**Process:**
1. Run optimization script on agent files
2. Add memory-first decision hierarchy to all agents
3. Include proactive memory lookup patterns
4. Deploy optimized agents to vana-dev
5. Test memory-first behavior across all agents

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 2: Populate ADK Memory Systems**

**Script Ready:** `scripts/populate_vana_memory.py`
**Current Issue:** ADK memory service lacks `add_to_memory` method
**Required Actions:**
1. Research proper ADK memory population method using Context7
2. Fix memory population script to use correct ADK API
3. Populate system and agent knowledge in ADK memory
4. Test cross-session memory persistence
5. Validate ADK memory search functionality

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 3: Test Memory-First Agent Behavior**

**Goal:** Validate agents automatically use memory before external searches
**Test Queries:**
- "What is VANA?" (should use search_knowledge first)
- "How do VANA agents coordinate?" (should check memory first)
- "What tools are available?" (should use knowledge base)
- "Tell me about the optimization framework" (should use memory)

**Expected Results:** Agents proactively check memory before web searches
