## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS

### **After Step 2 - Architecture Understanding**
**Self-Check Questions:**
- Can I accurately state the number of real vs proxy agents?
- Do I understand the actual tool inventory (19 core + conditional)?
- Is the architecture pattern clear (simplified multi-agent with proxy)?
- Are deployment environments confirmed (dev and prod URLs)?

**Expected Answers:**
- 7 discoverable agents (3 real: vana, code_execution_specialist, data_science_specialist + 4 proxy)
- 19 core tools across 6 categories + conditional specialist/orchestration tools
- Simplified architecture with proxy pattern for discovery (NOT complex 24-agent orchestration)
- Dev: vana-dev-960076421399.us-central1.run.app, Prod: vana-prod-960076421399.us-central1.run.app

### **After Step 4 - Technical Context**
**Self-Check Questions:**
- Do I understand the actual system capabilities vs aspirational features?
- Are the deployment infrastructure and tools clear?
- Can I distinguish between operational and conditional features?
- Do I have realistic expectations about system complexity?

**Expected Understanding:**
- System is operational but simplified (not complex orchestration)
- Google Cloud Run deployment with Python 3.13+ and Poetry
- Clear distinction between core tools (always available) and conditional tools
- Realistic assessment of current capabilities vs future potential

## 🚨 ACCURACY WARNINGS

### **Red Flags to Watch For**
If you encounter any of the following in Memory Bank content, report for verification:
- Claims of 20+ or 24+ agents (actual: 7 discoverable)
- Claims of 40+ or 50+ tools (actual: 19 core + conditional)
- "ALL TASKS COMPLETED" without specific evidence
- Complex orchestration claims without implementation proof
- Performance metrics without measurement methodology

### **Trust Indicators**
Look for these indicators of verified content:
- ✅ VERIFIED - Confirmed through code analysis
- Specific file references for technical claims
- Conservative language about capabilities
- Clear distinction between operational and aspirational features
- Recent verification dates (2025-06-15 or later)

---

## 🔄 FEEDBACK PROCESS

### **If You Find Inaccuracies**
1. **Document the Issue:** Note specific file and claim
2. **Verify Through Code:** Check actual implementation if possible
3. **Report Findings:** Include evidence and suggested corrections
4. **Request Validation:** Ask for verification of corrected information

### **Continuous Improvement**
