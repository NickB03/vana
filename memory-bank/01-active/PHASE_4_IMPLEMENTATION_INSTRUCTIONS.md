## 📋 PHASE 4 REQUIREMENTS

### **Performance Monitoring Components**
Based on the validated enhancement plan, implement:

1. **Response Time Monitoring**
   - Track agent response times
   - Monitor tool execution duration
   - Measure end-to-end request processing

2. **Error Rate Tracking**
   - Monitor system errors and exceptions
   - Track tool failure rates
   - Alert on error threshold breaches

3. **Resource Usage Metrics**
   - Memory consumption monitoring
   - CPU usage tracking
   - Database connection monitoring

4. **Performance Dashboards**
   - Real-time metrics visualization
   - Historical performance trends
   - System health indicators

5. **Alerting Mechanisms**
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Performance degradation detection
   - Automated notification systems

### **Quality Standards**
- **Use Context7** for ADK pattern research and best practices
- **Use Sequential Thinking** for structured implementation planning
- **Follow established ADK patterns** from reference implementations
- **Maintain comprehensive documentation** in Memory Bank

### **Deployment Requirements**
- **Test thoroughly** in cloud environment before claiming completion
- **Validate monitoring functionality** with real metrics and alerts
- **Ensure no regressions** in existing functionality
- **Document performance improvements** with measurable evidence
