## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT FINDINGS

### **✅ ACTUAL SYSTEM STATE (CODE-VERIFIED):**

**Real Agent Count: 3 + 4 Proxy = 7 Discoverable**
- **vana** - Main orchestrator (`agents/vana/team.py`)
- **code_execution_specialist** - Code execution (`agents/code_execution/specialist.py`)  
- **data_science_specialist** - Data science (`agents/data_science/specialist.py`)
- **memory, orchestration, specialists, workflows** - Proxy agents (redirect to VANA)

**Real Tool Count: 19 Core Tools + Conditional**
- **File System (4):** read_file, write_file, list_directory, file_exists
- **Search (3):** vector_search, web_search, search_knowledge  
- **System (2):** echo, get_health_status
- **Agent Coordination (4):** coordinate_task, delegate_to_agent, get_agent_status, transfer_to_agent
- **Task Analysis (3):** analyze_task, match_capabilities, classify_task
- **Workflow Management (8):** create_workflow, start_workflow, get_workflow_status, list_workflows, pause_workflow, resume_workflow, cancel_workflow, get_workflow_templates

**Real Architecture: Simplified with Proxy Pattern**
- Single main VANA agent with specialist agents
- Proxy pattern for agent discovery
- NOT complex 24-agent orchestration system

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS IMPLEMENTED

### **Universal Warning Pattern Applied:**
All core Memory Bank files now contain clear warnings:
- 🚨 **CONTENT ACCURACY AUDIT IN PROGRESS** 🚨
- **Status:** ⚠️ [SPECIFIC ISSUE] UNDER VERIFICATION
- **Action Required:** Do not rely on [SPECIFIC CLAIMS] until audit complete

### **Specific Warning Categories:**
1. **Agent Count Claims** - All references to 5+, 20+, 24+ agents marked as unverified
2. **Tool Count Claims** - All references to 30+, 46+, 59+ tools marked as unverified  
3. **Architecture Claims** - Complex orchestration claims marked as unverified
4. **Completion Claims** - Phase completion and "ALL TASKS COMPLETE" marked as unverified
