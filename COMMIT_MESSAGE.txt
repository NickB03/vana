docs: Major documentation cleanup - replace fiction with facts

BREAKING CHANGE: Documentation now reflects actual system behavior

Key changes:
- Replace README.md with truthful version based on actual testing
- Fix all port references from 8000 to 8081 (actual port)
- Remove unsubstantiated "46.2% infrastructure working" claim
- Document actual working features vs planned features
- Add "Last Tested" dates to verify accuracy
- Create automated verification script (docs/verify_documentation.py)

Documentation improvements:
- README now shows what actually works (3 endpoints, 8 tools)
- Added reality check disclaimer
- Listed known issues transparently
- Provided real command outputs from testing
- Created truth-based quick start guide
- Added system status report with evidence

Technical cleanup:
- Moved 31 files to organized directories (previous commit)
- Archived outdated documentation
- Fixed deprecated web search implementations
- Updated .gitignore to prevent future clutter

This change ensures developers get accurate information about:
- What features actually work today
- Real setup requirements (Python 3.13+, port 8081)
- Known limitations and issues
- Actual API responses

The new documentation philosophy: "Test first, document second"
