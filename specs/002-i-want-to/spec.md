# Feature Specification: Frontend Development Continuation

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to continue the frontend build that is in progress for this project. I have already created a comprehensive plan"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Continue existing frontend development work
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: End users, researchers, AI agents
   → Actions: Chat interface, research execution, result viewing
   → Data: Research queries, agent responses, session state
   → Constraints: Real-time streaming, multi-agent coordination
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Integration points with backend API marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Research query submission and result viewing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement covers UI components and user interactions
6. Identify Key Entities for frontend state management
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Focus on user experience and frontend functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher visits the Vana platform, enters a complex research question, and receives comprehensive research reports generated by multiple AI agents working in coordination. They can view real-time progress updates, interact with the chat interface, and access their research history through an intuitive web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they see the chat interface, **Then** they can immediately start typing their research question
2. **Given** a user submits a research query, **When** the multi-agent system processes it, **Then** they see real-time progress updates and streaming responses
3. **Given** a research session is in progress, **When** agents provide updates, **Then** the interface displays organized, readable content with proper formatting
4. **Given** a user has completed research sessions, **When** they return to the platform, **Then** they can access their research history and previous results
5. **Given** a user interacts with the interface, **When** they perform actions like scrolling or clicking, **Then** the interface responds smoothly without blocking the research process

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the backend API is unavailable or slow to respond?
- How does the interface handle very long research responses that exceed screen space?
- How does the system behave when multiple users access it simultaneously?
- What occurs when a research session is interrupted (browser refresh, network issues)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a clean, intuitive chat interface for submitting research questions
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real-time progress updates during multi-agent research execution via Server-Sent Events
- **FR-003**: System MUST present research results in a readable, well-formatted manner with proper markdown support
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view and scroll through long research responses without performance degradation
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback when research is in progress (loading states, progress indicators)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle user authentication and session management [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method and session persistence requirements]
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain chat history and allow users to access previous research sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: history retention period and storage limits]
- **FR-008**: System MUST be responsive and work across desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide error handling and graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with the existing FastAPI backend on localhost:8000
- **FR-011**: System MUST support dark/light theme switching for user preference
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide accessibility features for users with disabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific accessibility standards and compliance requirements]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Session**: Represents a research conversation, contains messages, timestamps, and session metadata
- **Research Query**: User's input question or prompt for the multi-agent system
- **Agent Response**: Individual responses from different AI agents during research process
- **Research Result**: Final compiled report containing all agent findings and analysis
- **User Session**: Authentication and preference data for personalized experience
- **Progress Update**: Real-time status information about ongoing research operations
