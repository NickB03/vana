# ADK Development Guide

## Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is Google's framework for building, testing, and deploying AI agents. VANA uses ADK version 0.2.0 for agent development.

## Key Components

1. **Agents**:
   - Created using the `Agent` class
   - Configured with a model, description, and instructions
   - Assigned tools for specific capabilities
   - Example: `ben = Agent(name="ben", model=MODEL, description="Project Lead", tools=[tool1, tool2])`

2. **Tools**:
   - Created using the `FunctionTool` class
   - Wrap Python functions to make them available to agents
   - Include descriptions and parameter definitions
   - Example: `search_tool = FunctionTool(func=search_knowledge)`

3. **Models**:
   - VANA uses Gemini 2.0 Flash as the default model
   - Configured via the MODEL environment variable
   - Accessed through Vertex AI

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Run `adk web` to start the local development server
   - Access the web interface at http://localhost:8000
   - Test agents and tools interactively

2. **Deployment**:
   - Use `deploy.py` to deploy agents to Vertex AI Agent Engine
   - Configure deployment settings in the script
   - Monitor deployed agents in the Google Cloud Console

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Design**:
   - Give clear, specific instructions to each agent
   - Limit each agent to a focused set of responsibilities
   - Use system messages to establish agent personality and behavior

2. **Tool Implementation**:
   - Keep tools simple and focused on a single task
   - Provide clear documentation in function docstrings
   - Handle errors gracefully within tools

3. **Testing**:
   - Test agents with a variety of inputs
   - Verify tool functionality independently
   - Check agent delegation and coordination

## Debugging

Common issues include:
- Import errors: Check package versions and imports
- Tool execution errors: Add error handling to tools
- Agent misunderstandings: Refine instructions and examples
