# Agent Architecture Overview

## Multi-Agent System Design

The VANA system uses a team of specialized agents coordinated by a lead agent. Each agent has specific responsibilities:

1. **Ben (Project Lead & DevOps Strategist)**: Coordinates tasks and ensures cross-agent harmony. All requests flow through Ben, who delegates to specialist agents as needed.

2. **Rhea (Meta-Architect of Agent Intelligence)**: Designs agent workflows, feedback loops, and memory systems. Specializes in agent orchestration and collaboration patterns.

3. **Max (Interaction Engineer)**: Creates interfaces that visualize agent decision-making in real-time. Focuses on making AI cognition transparent to users.

4. **Sage (Platform Automator)**: Deploys infrastructure that heals, scales, and evolves. Ensures the system remains reliable and performant.

5. **Kai (Edge Case Hunter)**: Tests the system with challenging scenarios and identifies potential failure modes. Improves system reliability through simulation.

6. **Juno (Story Engineer)**: Creates documentation, onboarding materials, and internal UX. Translates complex concepts into clear explanations.

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through a structured protocol:
- Task delegation from Ben to specialists
- Results reporting from specialists back to Ben
- Knowledge sharing through the Vector Search index
- Tool usage for specific capabilities

## Tool Integration

Agents have access to various tools:
- Knowledge retrieval via Vector Search
- Task coordination and delegation
- Domain-specific tools for each specialist agent

## Memory and Context

The system maintains context through:
- Shared Vector Search knowledge base
- Session history for ongoing conversations
- Agent-specific memory for specialized knowledge
