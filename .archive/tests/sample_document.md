# VANA Project Overview

VANA (Versatile Agent Network Architecture) is an intelligent agent system that leverages Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to provide powerful knowledge retrieval capabilities.

## Key Components

### Vector Search

VANA uses Vertex AI Vector Search for semantic search capabilities. This allows users to find information based on meaning rather than just keywords.

### Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph component provides structured representation of knowledge with entities and relationships. This enables more precise answers to complex queries.

### Document Processing

VANA includes advanced document processing capabilities:
- Semantic chunking
- Metadata extraction
- PDF support
- Multi-modal processing

## Integration

VANA integrates with:
- Google Cloud Platform
- Vertex AI
- Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Use Cases

1. Knowledge retrieval from documentation
2. Answering complex queries
3. Connecting information across sources
4. Providing context-aware responses
